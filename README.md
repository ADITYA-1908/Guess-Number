A compact C++ program has been developed to implement a small game wherein the computer selects a number, and the user's objective is to correctly guess this chosen number. 
With each guess made by the user, the computer provides feedback, indicating whether the guessed number is greater or smaller than the chosen number. 
The user achieves victory upon accurately guessing the predetermined number.
